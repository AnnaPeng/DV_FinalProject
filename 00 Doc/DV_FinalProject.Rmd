When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#First of all, We are going to source these packages below
```{r}
require("jsonlite")
require("RCurl")
require("dplyr")
require("ggplot2")
require("knitr")
require("dplyr")
require("extrafont")
```

#Next, we modified the R_ETL.R file and use it to create a table on SQL server. The modified versions are as follows:
##The tabel we get is as follows:

#Understanding Tableau Data Extract
##A Tableau data extract is a compressed snapshot of data stored on disk and loaded into memory as required to render a Tableau viz.There are two aspects of TDE design that make them ideal for supporting analytics and data discovery. 
##The first is that a TDE is a columnar store. Columnar databases store column values together rather than row values, and as a result, they dramatically reduce the input/output required to access and aggregate the values in a column.

##The second key aspect of TDE design is how they are structured which impacts how they are loaded into memory and used by Tableau.TDEs use all parts of your computer’s memory, from RAM to hard disk, and put each part to work as best fits its characteristics. To better understand, I tried to use connect to our data UK Car Fuel Consumptions and Emissions with an Extract API script in python, where I explored and walked through how a TDE is created from a CSV and then later used in our project as the data source for one or more visualizations.

##When Tableau creates a data extract, it first defines the structure for the TDE and creates separate files for each column in the underlying source.To complete the creation of a TDE, individual column files are combined with metadata to form a memory-mapped file. Because a TDE is a memory-mapped file, when Tableau requests data from a TDE, the data is loaded directly into memory by the operating system. Tableau doesn’t have to open, process or decompress the TDE to start using it. If necessary, the operating system continues to move data in and out of RAM to insure that all of the requested data is made available to Tableau. This is a key point - it means that Tableau can query data that is bigger than the available RAM on a machine!

#Experiment Tableau Data Extract
I extracted the first 5000 thousand rows of our dataset, carconsump.reformatted.csv of total of 10,000 rows and save it as a .tde called carconsump.reformatted_5000Rows.tde. So I created a TDE from a CSV. Follows are the procedures to create a TDE:

#Exploring Tableau Data Visualizations!
##Non-Aggregated Measures Analysis (start with a green thing) - also demonstrates Boxplots, Dates, and Pages
##Boxplot Story (start with a green thing)
###1. Open UK Car Consumption and Emissions. tde

###2. Uncheck Aggregate Measures under the Analysis tab and Rename the Current Sheet to Co2 Emissions Boxplot.

###3. Click on Co2 Under Measures and then click on the boxplot icon on "Show Me” i.e., the right icon on row 7.

###4. Drag Fuel Type onto Columns.

###5. Drag Manufacturer onto the Color Shelf.

###6. Drag Manufacturer onto the Filters Shelf and from this Pill's menu, select Show Quick Filter.

###7. Drag Engine onto Detail

###8. Drag Manufacturer onto Pages

###9. Filtered out the top 20 luxury cars

###10. Click through the luxury car brands on Pages 
###Ok brands

###The main fuel type used by this group of cars with price rage 30,000 - 150,000 are Diesel and Petrol. If using Deisel, Mercedez-Benz, Audi, BMW, Jaguar and all except Land Rover has mean emissions between 150 - 200 grammes per kilometre (g/km). If using Petrol, Mercedez-Benz, Audi, BMW have average near 200 grammes per kilometre (g/km). The worst performing manufacturer is Land Rover which has mean Co2 emissions up to 350 grammes per kilometre (g/km).

###Interestingly, top luxury car manufacturers such as Maserati, Lamborghini, Rolls-Royce, Ferrari, and Aston Martin Lagonda can only use one fuel type Petrol.
